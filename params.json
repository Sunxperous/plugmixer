Each time you DJ, one playlist will be activated randomly for your next turn.\r\n\r\n[![](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images/ChromeWebStore_Badge_v2_206x58.png)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plugmixer/bnfboihohdckgijdkplinpflifbbfmhm)\r\n\r\n## Bookmark script\r\n\r\n### Activating the script\r\n\r\nCopy and save the following as a bookmark:\r\n\r\n    javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10543516/plugmixer.js');}());\r\n    \r\nClick the bookmark when you are in plug.dj, and an indicator should show near the bottom right corner of the screen.\r\n\r\n### Disabling playlists\r\n\r\nClick on a playlist's __item count__ in the playlist menu to disable it. Disabled playlists are faded, and will not be activated by Plugmixer.\r\n\r\nClicking on the __item count__ again enables the playlist.\r\n\r\nNote that playlist states are _not persistent_ across __bookmarked script__ loads. All playlists will be re-enabled on each script load, and as such, also on each plug.dj refresh.\r\n\r\nPlaylist states are _persistent_ on the Chrome extension.\r\n\r\n### Deactivating Plugmixer\r\n\r\nClick on the __Active__ button on the Plugmixer indicator to deactivate Plugmixer.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://google.com\r\n","google":"UA-51104720-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
